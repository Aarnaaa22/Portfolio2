# Portfolio2
Hey there! I’m Aarna, a second-year engineering student navigating the vast and ever-changing ocean of technology. I’m still new to this world — just a curious beginner learning to ride the waves, one skill at a time. From web development and design to the basics of coding, every little step I take feels like discovering a new coral reef under the surface.

I may not know everything yet, but I love the process of figuring things out. I believe growth comes from getting lost, asking questions, and being okay with not knowing... for now. This portfolio is just a reflection of that journey — imperfect, evolving, and completely mine.

The tech world feels huge and deep, like the sea — and though I’m just swimming near the shore today, I’m ready to dive deeper every single day. Thanks for being here. Let’s grow together.
